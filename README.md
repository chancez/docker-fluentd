# Docker Fluentd

This is a minimal [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/) Docker image weighing in at < 170MB.
It is based on the excellent [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) [image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/gliderlabs/alpine/)s
from [Glider Labs](http://gliderlabs.com/) so it can use up to date components
but with minimal size.

## Current release: Fluentd 0.12.16 & Ruby 2.2.2
